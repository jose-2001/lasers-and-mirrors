# lasers-and-mirrors
This project was designed to simulate a maze of mirrors and lasers. It creates a matrix of given dimensions and puts the amount of mirrors given inside the matrix. 
The program has a menu with 4 options: 1. Play, 2. Display scores, 3. Toggle cheat mode, 4. Exit. The matrixes are created and their mirrors are positioned at random.
The point of the "game" is to find all the mirrors. The scores of the users are saved through serialization. You can find more details in the <a href="https://github.com/jose-2001/lasers-and-mirrors/tree/master/docs">docs/</a> folder of this project, it includes functional requirements and the class diagram in UML.<br>
